# Amber Framework Website

Official website for Amber web application framework. 

## Installation

Create a pg database called `demo` and configure the `config/database.yml`
to provide the credentials to access the table.

Then:

```sh
shards install
amber migrate up
```

## Usage

To run the demo:

```sh
crystal build src/amberframework.cr
./amberframework
```

## Front-end capabilities

Amber framework includes a minimal configuration to generate `main.bundle.js` and `main.bundle.css` using SCSS ans JavaScript.

On development use:

```sh
npm install
npm run watch
```

To generate minified bundles for production execute:

```sh
npm install
npm run release
```

## Docker and Docker Compose

This will start an instance of postgres, migrate the database, run the specs,
and launch the site at http://localhost:3000

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

To view the logs:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

Note: The Docker images are compatible with Heroku.
